## Introduction
Copper is a set of small Go packages that help you build APIs quickly. All of the packages are designed to work well together but are optional to use. You can start with a single package and add others as you need them.

Copper's goal is to make it easy and fast to build APIs with idiomatic Go. Copper makes full use of the already powerful Go standard library and exposes the primitives in a way where you have to write less boilerplate.
